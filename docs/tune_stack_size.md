Because [MAY][may] doesn't support automatic stack increasing, you have to determine the stack size of the coroutine
before running your application. Read [this][caveat] for more information.

When creating coroutines in [MAY][may], the library would alloc a chunk of memory from heap as the stack for each
coroutine. The default stack size is 4k words, in 64bit system it is 32k bytes. For most of the cases, this stack size
is big enough for simple coroutines. Buf if you have a very complicated coroutine that need more stack size, or you want
to shrink the stack size to save some memory usage, you can set the stack size explicitly to a reasonable value.

## Change default coroutine stack size

You can config the default stack size at the initialization stage. when create a coroutine and you not specify the stack
size for it, it will use this default stack size.

The unit is by `word`. the flowing code would set the default stack size as 8k bytes.

```rust
cogo::config().set_stack_size(0x400);
// this coroutine would use 8K bytes stack
go!(...);
```

## Set stack size for a single coroutine

You can use the coroutine `Builder` to specify a stack size for the new spawned coroutine. This would ignore the global
default stack size.

The following code would spawn a coroutine with 16k bytes stack

```rust
// this coroutine would use 16K bytes stack
let builder = cogo::coroutine::Builder::new().stack_size(0x800);
unsafe { builder.spawn(...) }.unwrap();
```

## Get the coroutine stack usage

If you need to know the exact stack usage number for your coroutine, you can set the stack size to an odd number. If the
passed in stack size is an odd number, [MAY][may] would initialize the whole stack for the coroutine with a special
pattern data, thus during the programme executing we can detect the **footprint** of the stack, after the coroutine is
finished, [MAY][may] would print out the actual usage.

For example the blow code

```rust
extern crate cogo;
use std::io::{self, Read};

fn main() {
    go!(
        cogo::coroutine::Builder::new()
            .name("test".to_owned())
            .stack_size(0x1000 - 1),
        || {
            println!("hello may");
        }
    ).unwrap();

    println!("Press any key to continue...");
    let _ = io::stdin().read(&mut [0u8]).unwrap();
}
```

would give output like this

```sh
hello may
coroutine name = Some("test"), stack size = 4095,  used size = 266
```
